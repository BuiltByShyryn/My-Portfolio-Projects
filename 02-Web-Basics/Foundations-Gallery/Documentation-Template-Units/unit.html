        <h1>Computer Programming</h1>
        <p>Computer programming is designing and building executable programs to solve specific tasks. It includes analysis, algorithm design, implementation in a programming language, and ensuring algorithms are accurate and efficient. The goal is to automate tasks on a computer. Programming requires expertise in various areas such as domain application, algorithms, and logic.</p>

    <dl id="history">
        <dt>History</dt>
        <dd>Programmable devices date back to 1206 with Al-Jazari's automata. The first computer program was created by Ada Lovelace in 1843, an algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers. Women dominated programming until the mid-1960s. In the 1880s, Herman Hollerith introduced machine-readable data. The concept of stored-program computers appeared in 1949. Early programs were written in machine code. Assembly languages, developed later, allowed more readable text-based instructions. Kathleen Booth created one of the first assembly languages in 1950.</dd>

        <dt>Modern Programming</dt>
        <dd>Reliability: How often a program produces correct results, considering conceptual accuracy and minimization of errors. Usability: How easy a program is to use, often determining its success. Portability: Ability to run on different hardware and operating systems. Maintainability: Ease of modifying the program for improvements or fixes. Efficiency: Measure of resource consumption like processor time and memory space.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl id="quality">
        <dt>Quality Requirements</dt>
        <dd>Programs must satisfy fundamental properties like reliability, usability, portability, and efficiency.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl id="readability">
        <dt>Readability of Source Code</dt>
        <dd>Readability refers to how easily a human can understand and modify source code. Unreadable code leads to bugs and inefficiencies.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl id="complexity">
        <dt>Algorithmic Complexity</dt>
        <dd>The 1950 "minimax" algorithm paper influenced algorithmic complexity. Chess programs, like IBM's Deep Blue, are studied in computer science.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl id="chess">
        <dt>Chess Algorithms</dt>
        <dd>Chess algorithms help computer programs play chess efficiently, and they have influenced the study of algorithms in computer science.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl id="languages">
        <dt>Programming Languages</dt>
        <dd>Languages differ in paradigms and are chosen based on task suitability, team expertise, and other factors. Low-level languages are machine-oriented; high-level languages are abstract but easier to use.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl id="programmers">
        <dt>Programmers</dt>
        <dd>Programmers perform tasks such as coding, debugging, documentation, and testing. They are responsible for various aspects of software development, including maintenance and architecture.</dd>
